<h2 id="wundertrading-tradingview-signals--copy-trading">🌐 WunderTrading: TradingView Signals & Copy Trading</h2>

<p>WunderTrading focuses on a social, terminal-driven experience. It integrates with major exchanges compatible with Oasis trading, including Binance, OKX, KuCoin, Bybit, and Kraken. 💹</p>

<p>Its highlight is <strong>TradingView signal</strong> integration and a <strong>copy-trading marketplace</strong>. Connect TradingView alerts to Wunder’s bots to execute custom or popular indicator strategies. 📉📈</p>

<p><strong>Copy-trading</strong> lets beginners mirror expert traders or sell strategies for rewards. 👥💸</p>

<p><strong>Key WunderTrading features:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Variety of Bots</strong> – DCA bots with trailing stops, Grid bots, and an AI-based bot. The <em>DCA Terminal</em> manages staggered buys and sells to average positions. ⚙️</li><br>

  <li><strong>Advanced Terminal</strong> – Multi-take-profit, trailing stops, futures spreads, arbitrage tools, and multi-account management via multi-API. 🖥️🔁</li><br>

  <li><strong>Portfolio Tracker & Internal Exchange</strong> – Monitor balances across accounts. Also includes a peer-to-peer exchange for direct crypto purchases with cards or bank transfers. 💳📊</li><br>

  <li><strong>Signal Marketplace & Copy Trading</strong> – Follow top bots/traders or monetize your own. Bonuses reward popular signal providers. 🧠📈💰</li><br>

  <li><strong>User-Friendly Onboarding</strong> – Free plan includes one active bot per type and paper trading. Paid tiers (e.g., Basic $19.95) increase limits. More complex than Bitsgap but ideal for social trading enthusiasts. 🚀📱</li>
</ul>

<p>WunderTrading is great if you want a unified terminal plus social & copy-trading features. Its free and low-cost plans make advanced features accessible. 💸</p>

<p>The tradeoff is mainly the lack of a dedicated mobile app (works via browsers). Copy-trading, DCA bots, and TradingView support shine here. 🤝📊</p>
